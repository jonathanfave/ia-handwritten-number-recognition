# ia-handwritten-number-recognition

- The aim will be to build a neural network that recognises handwritten numbers. This will be done using the PyTorch library.

- The aim will be to build a neural network that recognises handwritten digits. We will use the classic dataset [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

- We will consider a "dense" architecture (no Convolution here). Images will therefore be considered as vectors of size 28*28.
